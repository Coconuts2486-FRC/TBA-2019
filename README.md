#### Description:
TBA 2019 AKA Genesis is a Deep Learning, Azure Cloud based headless program thats intention is to simplify and optimize robot scouting in [FRC](https://www.firstinspires.org/robotics/frc) 
competitions. This programmed worked by initially taking in training data based off of numerous competitions and matches and feeding it through the [Deep Neural Network](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_learning)
. Once the model has been trained to predict robot's abilities, it can now be used at new competitions against new robots and still predict opponents and teammates capabilities that we used for 
strategies. The program was hosted on a Microsoft Azure Linux server and could be communicated with through the [Telegram API](https://telegram.org/).
